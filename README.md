# Advent of Code -- 2024

Trying to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for this year as a fun little programming challenge. I might do some in Python, some in Rust, heck, maybe even C# or JavaScript. Just want to use this as a way to challenge my brain and try to learn/relearn different languages.
